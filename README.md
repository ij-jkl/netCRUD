# .NET 8 CRUD Application

This is a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using .NET 8 and ASP.NET Core Web API. The application was developed with a focus on clean architecture by implementing the repository pattern, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. 

### Key Technologies and Tools
- **.NET 8**: The latest version of the .NET framework.
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**: For building and exposing RESTful endpoints.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database access, ORM functionality, and handling database migrations.
- **Repository Pattern**: To abstract data access logic, ensuring cleaner separation of concerns.
- **FluentValidation**: For validating data input and ensuring proper structure and constraints before processing.
- **BCrypt**: For securely hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Used for containerizing the application with a Dockerfile and orchestrating multi-service setups using Docker Compose.
- **Swagger**: Integrated Swagger UI to easily test and document the API endpoints.
